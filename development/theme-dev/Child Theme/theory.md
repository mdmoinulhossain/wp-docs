# A child theme by default consists of only 2 files a style.css file and a functions.php file. and screenshot.jpg is for theme image.

# All the different parameters (Theme Name, Theme URI, Description...etc) should be consistent with your site the only value you should not change is the Template, this should always say "Astra" as that is the name of the parent theme.
