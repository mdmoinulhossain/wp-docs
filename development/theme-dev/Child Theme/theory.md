# A child theme by default consists of only 2 files a style.css file and a functions.php file. and screenshot.jpg is for theme image.

# All the different parameters (Theme Name, Theme URI, Description...etc) should be consistent with your site the only value you should not change is the Template, this should always say "Astra" as that is the name of the parent theme.

```
Key Points to Check:
1. Template: Make sure that the Template line matches the directory name of the parent theme. The correct template name for the "Hello Elementor" theme is typically hello-elementor (all lowercase without spaces).

2. Text Domain: Ensure that your text domain matches the convention hello-elementor-child (all lowercase and typically separated by hyphens).
